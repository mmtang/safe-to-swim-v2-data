    "# Processing FIB data for the Safe to Swim map (v2)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The following code processes fecal indicator bacteria data (FIB) for the Safe to Swim map (v2), which is currently in development. It sources FIB data from the [BeachWatch](https://beachwatch.waterboards.ca.gov/) and [California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN)](https://ceden.org/) databases, both of which are managed by the [State Water Resources Control Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/). It also sources data from the [Lower American River Recreational Water Quality Web App](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/47e27f245e044ac2a8e15083307e75f6/?draft=true&org=waterboards), which is managed by the Central Valley Regional Water Board. This script integrates the three datasets and calculates the rolling 30-day and 6-week geometric mean values for each sample data point. The FIB data used in this script includes sampling data for *E. coli*, Enterococcus, Fecal Coliform, and Total Coliform."

    "Even though we excluded BeachWatch records when pulling data from CEDEN (Step 2.2), there are still some duplicate BeachWatch records in CEDEN because these records are submitted to CEDEN under a different program name (i.e., not BeachWatch). \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this is StationCode == 'Wharf-East' for Total coliform, sample taken on 9/5/2019. There are three data points for the same result, one in BeachWatch and two in CEDEN. They mostly have the same values in every column except for Program, ResultQualCode, and QACode. The Program value in BeachWatch is \"BeachWatch\" whereas the Program values in CEDEN are \"BeachWatch\" and \"Santa Cruz City Environmental Program\". The BeachWatch record was copied over into CEDEN from the BeachWatch database, and the other record was submitted to CEDEN under a different program name. Because the SQL query used in Step 2.2 only excludes records that have a Program value of \"BeachWatch\", the latter record would still make it into the combined dataset.\n",

When comparing one record to another, the code is looking for at least one unique value across all of these columns. If the values for both records across all columns are the same, then it is considered a duplicate record. This list of columns can be changed, as needed."
